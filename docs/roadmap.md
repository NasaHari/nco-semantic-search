# Development Roadmap

Based on 9-day STATATHON timeline (Aug 7-15, 2025):

- **Day 1-2**: Setup, data ingestion, preprocessing (scripts/preprocess.py).
- **Day 3-4**: Embeddings and indexing (embed.py, index.py).
- **Day 5-6**: Search logic and UI (search.py, app.py).
- **Day 7-8**: Testing, evaluation, and documentation.
- **Day 9**: Final tweaks and submission.

Milestones: MVP by Day 6, polished by Day 8.
